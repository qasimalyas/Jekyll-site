<h1>Labs</h1>
<p>This area of the site is dedicated to experimenting with different techniques with web technologies. The web is evolving constantly and is giving developers the capabilities to create truly unique solutions.</p>
<p>I will be showcasing any and all of my experimental code here for others to see and explain how it all works. It will also allow me to really refine and provide fall back solutions should I choose to use the feature on a client site. It&rsquo;s also a great way to keep up-to-date with the latest technolgies and contributing to the open web.</p>
